Changes
=======

1.0 in development
------------------

 * **DEPRECATION**: Removed 2PC support documentation.
 * **DEPRECATION**: Removed pg_python and pg_dotconf 'scripts'.
   They are still accessible by python3 -m postgresql.bin.pg_*
 * Added db.do() method for DO-statement support(convenience method).
 * Fix handling of unix domain sockets by pg.open and driver.connect.
   [Reported by twitter.com/rintavarustus]
 * Set the default client_min_messages level to WARNING.
   NOTICEs are often not desired by programmers, and py-postgresql's
   high verbosity further irritates that case.
 * Added postgresql.project module to provide project information.
   Project name, author, version, etc.
 * Fixed db.tracer and pg_python's --pq-trace=
 * Increased default recvsize and chunksize for improved performance.
 * 'D' messages are special cased as builtins.tuples instead of
   protocol.element3.Tuple
 * Alter Statement.chunks() to return chunks of builtins.tuple. Being
   an interface intended for speed, types.Row() impedes its performance.
 * Fix handling of infinity values with timestamptz, timestamp, and date.
   Bug reported by Axel Rau.
 * Correct representation of PostgreSQL ARRAYs by properly recording
   lowerbounds and upperbounds. Internally, sub-ARRAYs have their own
   element lists.

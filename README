About py-postgresql
===================

py-postgresql is a Python 3 package providing modules to work with PostgreSQL.
This includes a high-level driver, and many other tools that support a developer
working with PostgreSQL databases.

The goal of this project is to provide substantial convenience to Python
developers working with PostgreSQL.


Installation
------------

Installation should be as simple as::

	$ python3.0 ./setup.py install


Further information is available via: python -m postgresql.documentation.admin


Basic Driver Usage
------------------

Using PG-API is recommended as it provides more utility for the user. However, a
DB-API 2.0 driver is provided: `postgresql.driver.dbapi20`.

Sample PG-API Code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	import postgreql.driver as pg_driver

	# Alter the parameters accordingly
	db = pg_driver.connect(user = 'myuser', host = 'localhost', port = 5432, database = 'mydbname', password = 'secret')

	# create a prepared statement
	get_table = db.prepare("select * from information_schema.tables where table_name = $1")
	for x in get_table("tables"):
		print(x)
	print(get_table.first("tables"))


Further Information
-------------------

The documentation directory, `postgresql/documentation`, contains more detailed
information on the modules herein, and HTML versions of the documentation can
be found at::

Or, you can read them in your pager: python -m postgresql.documentation.index
